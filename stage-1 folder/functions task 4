#Finally, write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle (synthesize if you donâ€™t have one). 
#Feel free to pad it with extra words if they are not of the same length.

#Solution

xusername = ["ebube_adiele1", "svetlana", "hariv"]
slackusername = ["Ebubechiokike", "Svetlana", "Hajah"]

# Function to calculate the Hamming distance
def hamming_distance(str1, str2):
    # Ensure both strings are of equal length
    length = min(len(str1), len(str2))

    # Calculate the Hamming distance
    distance = 0
    for i in range(length):
        if str1[i].lower() != str2[i].lower():  # Case insensitive comparison
            distance += 1
    return distance

# Iterate through both lists and calculate Hamming distance for each pair
for i in range(len(xusername)):
    dist = hamming_distance(xusername[i], slackusername[i])
    print(f"Hamming distance between '{xusername[i]}' and '{slackusername[i]}': {dist}")
